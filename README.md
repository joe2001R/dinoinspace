Hello. Here is a small 2d game I made using lua and its love2d framework. (I tried to make an icy tower clone)
I also included an agent that will play the game for you (no self-learning algorithms, only a simple imperfect greedy agent).
I got clumsy during the coding process. Regardless, I hope that you will enjoy it.
I made sure to include the source of every asset that I have used; Please correct me if I am wrong.
I am more than happy to hear what changes will make my code/game much better. Thank you for your time!
