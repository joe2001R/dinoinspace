Hello. Here is a small 2d game I made using lua and its love2d framework. (I tried to make an icy tower clone)
I included an agent that will play the game for you (no self-learning algorithms, only a simple greedy agent).
I was clumsy during the coding process. Regardless, I hope that you will enjoy it.
